### SUMMARY
Practical implementation of a concurrent algorithm, using threads. Project of the 42 cursus.

### 3 IMPLEMENTATIONS
- the one we had to do at 42 School, in C
- two that I did in C++; these ones are simpler, with no timings or other constraints. One was done with mutexes and the other with lockguard
