# Dining Philosophers
In this repo I have 3 implementations:
- the one we had to do at 42 School, in C.
- two that I did in C++ when going through the Critical Techworks C++ Academy; these ones are simpler, with no timings or other constraints. One was done with mutexes and the other with lockguard.
