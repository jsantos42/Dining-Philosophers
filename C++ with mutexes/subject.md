## Philosophers dinner
Implement the Philosopher's dinner using the threading capabilities of C++.
Each philosopher thinks or eats. A number of philosophers are seated in a round table, between each philosopher there's a fork.
To be able to eat, the philosopher must grab two forks, one at the left and another to the right. Notice that this will mean that if a philosopher is already eating at left or right, the philosopher is unable to grab both forks to start eating.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The max number of Philosophers is 10
* Each Philosopher will grab a fork at a time
* The Philosopher is either eating of thinking
* Do a console output for each Philosopher, when thinking or eating.
